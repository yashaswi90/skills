Generate a changelog for all changes from the most recent release until now.

## Steps
1. Find the most recent release tag using `git tag --sort=-creatordate`
2. Get commits and merged PRs since that tag
3. Look at previous releases in this repo to match their format and style
4. Categorize changes into sections: Breaking Changes, Added, Changed, Fixed, Notes
5. Focus on user-facing changes (features, important bug fixes, breaking changes)
6. Include PR links and contributor attribution

## Output
Present the changelog in a markdown code block, ready to copy-paste into a GitHub release.
